### sfml-toys
Some fun stuff I made while learning about libsfml

Cool Demo Tier List:
<ol type="a">
  <li>particles</li>
</ol>

Each item corresponds to a Makefile target

#### cool-ideas
- A weird sort of broken tetris
- Bullet Hell Demo
- Chemical reaction simulator(think sand-game but real)
- Noise/Sfx making tool
- 2d map generation (erosion based)
- Fractal generator (given simple definition of fractal)
- Program to sum/take product of a bunch of probability distributions together
- Neural Net Visualization
- DE Vector field visualizations
- Fourier transform visualization
- Simulate the life of a cube, cube-herds
- Water droplets on liquid surface
- Build-3D-Renderer-From-First-Principles (i.e. manipulating at the sf::Image level)
- 3d real-number grapher (would require implementing interpeter)
- Data structure toy (possibly better for wxWidgets?)
